# Starter pipeline for HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP project for Firebase

# This pipeline will trigger on any commit to any branch.
# This is good for early stages to get quick feedback.
trigger:
- '*' # Triggers on changes to all branches

# Link to your secret variable group for Firebase credentials
# IMPORTANT: Replace 'FirebaseSecrets' with the actual name of your variable group!
variables:
- group: FirebaseSecrets

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest # Use a Linux agent, suitable for Node.js, PHP, and general development

steps:
- checkout: self # Ensures the pipeline checks out your repository code

- task: NodeTool@0 # Install Node.js for frontend tools (npm, bundling, etc.)
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18.x' # Or a specific version you prefer (e.g., '16.x', '20.x')
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    echo "Installing frontend dependencies..."

  displayName: 'Install Frontend Dependencies (npm)'
  condition: and(succeeded(), exists('package.json')) # Only run if package.json exists

- script: |
    echo "Building frontend assets..."
    npm run build # Placeholder for building frontend assets (e.g., Webpack, Vite, etc.)
  displayName: 'Build Frontend Assets'
  condition: and(succeeded(), exists('package.json')) # Only run if package.json exists and there's a build script

- task: UsePHP@0 # Install PHP
  inputs:
    version: '8.2' # Or a specific PHP version you plan to use (e.g., '8.1', '8.3')
  displayName: 'Install PHP'

- script: |

    # vendor/bin/phpunit # Uncomment and configure when you have PHP tests
  displayName: 'Run PHP Tests'
  condition: and(succeeded(), exists('composer.json'))

# --- Firebase Deployment Stage ---
# This stage only runs if the previous build/test steps succeed.
# It uses a condition to only deploy from the 'main' branch to production hosting.
# For other branches, you might deploy to a test channel or not deploy at all.

- stage: Deploy
  displayName: 'Deploy to Firebase'
  dependsOn: [] # This stage can run after the build stage, no specific dependency needed here
  condition: and(ssucceeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')) # Only deploy main branch

  jobs:
  - job: DeployToFirebaseHosting
    displayName: 'Deploy Frontend to Firebase Hosting'
    pool:

    steps:
    - task: NodeTool@0 # Ensure Node.js is available for Firebase CLI
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '18.x'
      displayName: 'Install Node.js for Firebase CLI'

    - script: |

    # If you have a 'public' directory for Firebase Hosting, you might also need to
    # specify it in your firebase.json and ensure your build process outputs to it.
    # By default, Firebase Hosting looks for index.html in the root or public/.
    # You will create a firebase.json file later when you run `firebase init` locally.

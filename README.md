# Gadis Salon Management Website

This is the official web-based counterpart to the Gadis Salon native Android application, developed as a final-year project for Rosebank College. This platform provides a powerful, browser-based interface for stylists and administrators to manage the salon's operations in real-time, fully synchronized with the mobile app through Google Firebase.

## üåü Project Overview

This web application serves two key user roles‚ÄîStylist and Admin‚Äîeach with a dedicated, secure dashboard. It empowers the salon's staff to manage everything from client bookings and product inventory to user accounts and support tickets, all from the convenience of a web browser. Built with a robust front-end using modern web standards, it connects to the same powerful Google Firebase backend as the Android app, ensuring a seamless and unified digital ecosystem for Gadis Salon.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
* A local server for development (like the **Live Server** extension for VS Code is recommended).

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_WEBSITE_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
    ```

2.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    * Navigate to the `js/` folder.
    * **Rename** the file `firebase-config.example.js` to `firebase-config.js`.
    * Open the new `firebase-config.js` file.
    * **Replace the placeholder values** (like `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`) with the actual Firebase credentials from your project console. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.

3.  **Run the Website:**
    * Open the project folder in your code editor.
    * If using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".
    * Otherwise, open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

## üß™ Installation & Testing

1.  **Enable Firebase Services:** In your Firebase console, ensure **Authentication**, **Cloud Firestore**, and **Firebase Storage** are enabled.
2.  **Deploy Cloud Functions:** Deploy the functions located in the `/functions` directory of your project using the Firebase CLI. This is required for creating and managing users.
3.  **Create First Admin User:**
    * Create a user account through your app or website.
    * Use the provided Node.js script (`setAdmin.js`) to promote that user to an admin. You will need a service account key from your Firebase project settings to run this script.
    * **Log out and log back in** for the admin privileges to take effect.
